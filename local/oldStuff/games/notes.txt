# folders:
- scripts
- assets
	- audio
	- images
- css
index.html

use a general game library (my own)?

# class structure
- game (general rendering)
	- player (movement)
	- environment (stuff to interact)
	- atmosphere (music, bg)
	- ui (buttons, settings)
	- animation

make collision a library function

animations:
	multiple on one object
	different animations

# ideas:
	-save on server (display other creations)? (rate?)
		(super small file only pixel per pixel?)
	-multiple colors (custom colors?)
	-shaders?
	animation:
		drawRec expanding on delete/inward on draw (with the environment color)
	ui:
		save (inbrowser or file), load
		sound settings (off/on/loudness?)
		score? (time spend active(longer better) + interactions(only matter much in the beginning)?)
		hint button?
	sound:
		background atmosphere
		sounds: draw/delete, ui-interact, wall


# later:
const audio = new Audio("audio.mp3");
function playSound() {
    audio.play();
}
function pauseSound() {
    audio.pause();
}
window.onload = () => {
    playSound();
};
